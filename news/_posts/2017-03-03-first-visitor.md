The lab welcomes its first visitor. Matt Salie from the [Williamson Lab](https://williamson.scripps.edu/) at the Scripps Research Institute is visiting us this week to gain experience with continuous culturing techniques and gather preliminary data for his postdoctoral work on proteome dynamics. Welcome Matt!
