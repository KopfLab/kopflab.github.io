The Geomicorobiology culturing lab is a central resource for the Geobiology community at CU Boulder and beyond that is jointly directed by Profs. [Sebastian Kopf](/people/skopf) and [Boswell Wing](/people/bwing). The lab currently occupies 715 sq. ft. of newly renovated laboratory space in the Benson Earth Sciences building with renovations for expansion (3x the space) scheduled to begin mid 2019. This wet chemistry lab was specifically designed for aerobic and anaerobic culturing, continuous culture, sample preparation, fluorescence microscopy, and molecular work. The lab has a dedicated 15-foot work bench for the operation of chemostats in addition to experimental bench space for 6 researches and a separate, dedicated dark room. The available equipment comprises standard geochemical and culturing infrastructure including analytical balances, pH meters, a chemical fume hood (8’), laminar flow biosafety cabinet (4’), refrigerators (4C), freezers (-80C and -20C), temperature controlled incubators, drying oven, water purification system, refrigerated centrifuge, microcentrifuges and a 120L autoclave; two 8-port gas supply manifolds with digital mass flow controller-based custom blending of up to 4 gases; molecular equipment including gel imager, electrophoresis equipment, gradient PCR machine, and quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR); microscopy equipment including a phase contrast light microscope (Zeiss PrimoStar) and inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss AxioVert 200M); analytical equipment including a spectrophotometer (Thermo Spectronic20), spectral analyzer (OceanOptics), Coulter Counter (Beckam Coulter Multisizer 4e) and multi-mode absorbance/fluorescence/luminescence plate reader (Biotek Synergy H1); as well as continuous culture equipment including seeral prototyping bioreactor systems for aerobic and anaerobic continuous culture (operating volumes from 0.5 to 3L; active temperature, aeration, mixing and pH control; continuous monitoring of gas flow and backpressure via digital mass flow controllers; continuous monitoring of pH, ORP, pO2 via steam-sterilizable Mettler Toledo InPro process sensors) and a multiplexed ministat continuous culture system with up to 20 parallel cultures and culture conditions.
