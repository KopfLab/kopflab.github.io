Two new papers out in the Journal of Bacteriology and Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, respectively, by Caltech collaborator Caj Neubauer on refinements of heavy water lipid-SIP and its application in cystic fibrosis research: *Refining the Application of Microbial Lipids as Tracers of Staphylococcus aureus Growth Rates in Cystic Fibrosis Sputum* and *Towards measuring growth rates of pathogens during infections by D2O-labeling lipidomics*. Congrats Caj! See [publications](/publications) for full references and [this link](https://jb.asm.org/content/200/24/e00540-18) for a great commentary on this work by Tara Gallagher, Joann Phan and Katrine Whiteson.
