## How to wire the LED circuit?

In this lightbox, we are using 4x AA batteries as the power source which provides a total of 4x 1.5V = 6V to drive our LEDs. To check which/how many LEDs we can power with this, we need to know the characteristic "forward voltage" of each LED (the approximate voltage drop across the LED). This voltage mostly depends on the color of the LED, for example red LEDs will typically have a forward voltage of 1.8-2.2 V while green LEDs might have 3.2-3.8 V. You can get the forward voltages from your LED datasheets (often denoted Vf) or estimate them from the typical values for the color in use (e.g. by looking up [LED voltages on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#Colors_and_materials)).

To maximize battery life, it is best to wire the LEDs in series. This makes it easy to limit total current and the circuit has only 3 components: 1) the battery pack to power the circuit (here **6V**), 2) a resistor to control current flow, and 3) our LEDs. For an example circuit, we are including one red LED (forward voltage ~1.9V) and one green LED (forward voltage ~3.3V). To calculate which resistor to use, **determine the leftover voltage** in the circuit $$\left(V = 6\text{ V} - \sum V_f=6\text{ V} - 1.9\text{ V} - 3.3\text{ V} = 0.8\text{ V}\right)$$, then decide what current to run at. Typically LEDs are rated at a maximum current of ~20mA but **you can always run an LED with less current to reduce brightness and increase battery life**. For the example circuit, we will aim to run at **10mA** which is not maximum brightness but still quite a bit of light for bacterial phototrophs. Using Ohm's law, the required resistor is $$R = V/I = 0.8\text{ V}/10\text{ mA} = 80\text{ Ohm}$$. Resistors are usually available at specific values, a [useful set](https://www.amazon.com/E-Projects-EPC-103-Value-Resistor-Kit/dp/B00E9YQQSS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1465668761) that covers many scenarios for the light box includes 10, 22, 47, 100 and 220 Ohm resistors. Rounding up to the closest resistor for the example circuit means we'll go with the **100 Ohm** resistor.

Wire the circuit as illustrated in the diagram. Polarity matters for LEDs so the positive pole (usually **red wire** from the battery pack) has to **connect to the anode** of the LED, which is typically the longer lead (testing which one is the right one by swapping the connections will NOT hurt the LED, it just won't light up). Make sure that the wiring is correct by turning on the battery pack, all LEDs in the circuit should light up (note that you will not see IR LEDs with the naked eye). If not, check for any loose wiring, accidental shorts (wires touching), correct polarity on the LEDs and sufficient battery charge. To keep connections tight and insulated from each other, twist wires together firmly and wrap with a layer of electrical tape or heat shrink.

## How long can I run the lightbox for?

The total capacity (=lifetime) of a battery depends strongly on the material and the discharge rate. At low currents (<100mA), decent quality AA **alkaline** batteries, for example, typically have a capacity of ~2200 mAh (but they perform much worse at high discharge rates). This means that if you **run your LED circuit at 10mA**, your battery pack will last for 2200 mAh / 10 mA = 250 hours, or **roughly 9 days**! That is a pretty solid amount of time for in situ phototroph enrichments. If you want brighter LEDs and are running at 20mA, you will need to replace the batteries after ~4.5 days.

## Additional advice on the circuit

 - **Battery life**: Since the nominal LED voltages are often only approximate, it is important to note that the exact current may vary from your theoretical calculations. This is not a problem unless you need precise estimates of the light output and/or expected battery life. If you have access to a multimeter, you can measure the actual current and if needed simply fine-tune your circuit by adjusting the resistor.

 - **Resistor ratings**: It is good practice to check the power rating of your resistor although this is unlikely to be a problem for the lightbox. The resistors linked/pictured in this tutorial are rated for 0.25 W (with 5% tolerance), which is far above what is necessary for this circuit even if running at maximum 25 mA
 $$\left( P=V\cdot I=0.8\text{ V}\cdot 25\text{ mA}=0.02\text{ W} \right)$$.

 - **Higher voltage LEDs**: If you want to drive several higher voltage LEDs (e.g. mutiple green, blue or UV), the 6V available from the 4 x AA battery pack may not be sufficient to drive them in series. You can either try to fit more batteries into the light box to increase total circuit voltage, use higher voltage batteries (be mindful of the trade-off in total capacity), or wire your LEDs in parallel instead of in series (adding the appropriate resistor for each LED) with the caveat this circuit will consume a lot more current so the batteries will not last as long!
