Our collaborative proposal with the [Leavitt lab](https://www.geobio.rocks/) at Dartmouth into the isotopic signatures of archaeal lipid biomarkers got funded by NSF.  This will be a fantastic collaboration that has been several years in the planning and we look very much forward to working closely with the team at Dartmouth.
