### Our culturing lab finished construction!

After several months of [renovations](/news/gmp-lab-renovations-start/), the construction on the Geomicrobial Physiology culturing lab in the Benson Earth Sciences building wrapped up earlier this week and we officially moved in today. Several pieces of equipment are already set up and ready to go and the first set of experiments is under way - it's going to be an exciting Spring!
