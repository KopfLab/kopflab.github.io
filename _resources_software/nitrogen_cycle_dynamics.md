This app is a visual tool to explore the isotope dynamics of the nitrogen cycle. Its goal is to make the different processes more accessible and help students gain a more intuitive understanding of how they change the ocean's nitrogen reservoirs. All plots can be saved as PDF and can of course be used freely, especially for educational purposes. The application is released as open software under the GNU General Public License 3.0.
