  abstract = {Stable isotope data have made pivotal contributions to nearly every discipline of the physical and natural sciences. As the generation and application of stable isotope data continues to grow exponentially, so does the need for a unifying data repository to improve accessibility and promote collaborative engagement. This paper provides an overview of the design, development, and implementation of IsoBank (www.isobank.org), a community-driven initiative to create an open-access repository for stable isotope data implemented online in 2021. A central goal of IsoBank is to provide a web-accessible database supporting interdisciplinary stable isotope research and educational opportunities. To achieve this goal, we convened a multi-disciplinary group of over 40 analytical experts, stable isotope researchers, database managers, and web developers to collaboratively design the database. This paper outlines the main features of IsoBank and provides a focused description of the core metadata structure. We present plans for future database and tool development and engagement across the scientific community. These efforts will help facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among the many users of stable isotopic data while also offering useful data resources and standardization of metadata reporting across eco-geoinformatics landscapes.},

  abstract = "{Rates of microbial growth are fundamental to understanding environmental geochemistry and ecology. However, measuring the heterogeneity of microbial activity at the single-cell level, especially within complex populations and environmental matrices, remains a forefront challenge. Stable isotope probing (SIP) is a method for assessing microbial growth and involves measuring the incorporation of an isotopic label into microbial biomass. Here, we assess Raman microspectroscopy as a SIP technique, specifically focusing on the measurement of deuterium (2H), a tracer of microbial biomass production. We correlatively measured cells grown in varying concentrations of deuterated water with both Raman spectroscopy and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS), generating isotopic calibrations of microbial 2H. Relative to Raman, we find that nanoSIMS measurements of 2H are subject to substantial dilution due to rapid exchange of H during sample washing. We apply our Raman-derived calibration to a numerical model of microbial growth, explicitly parameterizing the factors controlling growth rate quantification and demonstrating that Raman–SIP can sensitively measure the growth of microorganisms with doubling times ranging from hours to years. The measurement of single-cell growth with Raman spectroscopy, a rapid, nondestructive technique, represents an important step toward application of single-cell analysis into complex sample matrices or cellular assemblages.}",
