The Tube Tower is a flexible 3D printer layout for small foot print vertical incubation of anaerobic (i.e. stoppered & crimp-sealed) balch culture tubes. Gas exchange between media and headspace is maximized due to the horizontal position of the tubes. Tubes are secured in place with a 6" (15.2cm) wide 1/8" (3.2mm) thick standard acryl panel that slides in from the top. The below tower layouts are 16.4 cm wide and 12 cm deep. The height of each tower varies depending on number of vial rows.
