The first [Rocky Mountain Geobiology Symposium (RMGS)](https://rmgs2017.wordpress.com/) took place at the [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) in Golden, CO with participants from all over the Rocky Mountain states and beyond enjoying a fantastic day of science, new connections, sunny Colorado spring weather and a memorable end-of-day at Golden's New Terrain Brewing. Big thanks to John Spear, Emily Kraus, Blake Stamps and everyone at Mines for all the hard work fundraising and organizing an amazing day to kick off the RMGS tradition.
