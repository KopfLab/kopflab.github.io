## About

I started at the University of Colorado Boulder in Fall 2016 as Assistant Professor of Geomicrobiology. My lab is part of the Geobiology group at CU Boulder whose primary home is in the Department of Geological Sciences, with additional ties to the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) and the Biofrontiers Institute. I am the main PI of the Geomicrobial Physiology Lab in the Benson Earth Sciences Building where we do most of our culturing and molecular work, and am a co-director of the Organic Geochemistry Core Lab (together with Julio Sep√∫lveda and Gifford Miller), which houses joint analytical instrumentation and great preparatory infrastructure for organic geochemistry in the brand-new laboratory building of the Sustainability, Energy, Environment Complex (SEEC).

I am interested in a wide range of biogeochemical and geobiological questions with a particular focus on research aimed at understanding (and reconstituting) environmentally relevant growth conditions and uncovering the physiological basis and environmental production of biological signatures. When not busy taming microbes in the lab I love to explore the Colorado back-country (on foot or skis), tinker with electronics and 3D printing, and cultivate wild sourdough starters in search of the perfect bread.
