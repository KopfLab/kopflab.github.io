This app is intended for use in estimating expected enrichments from stable isotope labeling in microbial populations. It is based on isotopic enrichment resulting from unbiased clonal growth in the presence of an isotopic label. This app is intended to make it easy to explore this space for different isotope systems and takes care of all the isotope conversions and mixing calculations between existing and isotopically labelled pools.
