## About

The Tube Tower is a flexible 3D printer layout for small foot print vertical incubation of anaerobic (i.e. stoppered & crimp-sealed) balch culture tubes. Gas exchange between media and headspace is maximized due to the horizontal position of the tubes. Tubes are secured in place with a 6" (15.2cm) wide 1/8" (3.2mm) thick standard acryl panel that slides in from the top.
