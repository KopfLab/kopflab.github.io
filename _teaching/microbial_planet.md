Microbes are everywhere! They are the unseen force that rules our planet – present, past and future. Ingenious tiny master chemists too small to see by naked eye yet so powerful and resilient they can survive even the most extreme places on our planet – boiling hot, freezing cold, bone-dissolving acid, the vacuum of space! We invite you to join and learn why microbes play such a crucial role in the functioning of Earth’s ecosystems, how they affect our everyday lives, and what we can do to employ them towards solving the challenges of the 21st century.
