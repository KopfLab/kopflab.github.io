# About

I have always been fascinated with the world around me, which drew me to science.  My experience lies mainly in microbiology, molecular biology, and analytical chemistry.  I've been fortunate to work in many interesting fields including environmental remediation, renewable and sustainable energy, and studying the microbial communities found in ecosystems as well as the human microbiome.  I am thrilled to be part of the Kopf/Wing labs where I can apply my unique skill set while learning even more about our amazing world.
