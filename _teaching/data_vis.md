This special topics seminar discusses theory, best practices, and common pitfalls of data visualization with hands-on exercises in RMarkdown using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and its powerful grammar-of-graphics approach. Best for grad students/postdocs/researchers who have specific data sets they want to work on visualizing. This seminar uses [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)-style [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for programming, as well as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control and instructor/peer feedback. No prior experience with these tools is required but some experience with at least **one** programming language (R, python, matlab, C++, fortran) is highly recommended.
