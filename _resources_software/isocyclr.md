This R package is intended as an educational tool to facilitate the modeling of isotopic effects through biogeochemical pathways and cycles including non-steady state and steady-state solutions. Core functionality for the construction of reaction networks and the corresponding system of differential equations is fully implemented and can be explored for multiple isotope systems in parallel. Automatically generated reaction diagrams and symbolic representation of the system of differential equations make it easy to check system structure.
