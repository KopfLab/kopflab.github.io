The mediatools package is a collection of tools to simplify working with the chemical composition and speciation of defined culture media for microbial physiology and environmental microbiology research. It includes a wide range of general purpose functionality for chemical applications including built-in, data-frame-compatible chemical quantities (volume, mass, molarity, temperature, pressure, etc.) that automatically keep track of their units and metric scaling, as well as more specialized tools for the assembly and comparison of culturing media recipes, pH buffering strategies and aqueous speciation.
