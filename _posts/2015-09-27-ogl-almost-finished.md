The Sustainability, Energy and Environment Complex ([SEEC](http://www.colorado.edu/supportcu/sustainability-energy-and-environment-complex/seec-details)) is almost finished with a brand-new three story wet chemistry laboratory building attached via sky-bridge to the existing office and dry lab spaces. The Organic Geochemistry Laboratory will be housed on the second floor of this new building and comprise a large open lab space for joint equipment and research space. Construction has entered its final phase and we are planning to start the move into this fantastic new lab in Spring 2016.
