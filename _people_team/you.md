Interested in the Geomicrobial Physiology Lab in beautiful Boulder, Colorado? Please check the information below and contact [Sebastian](/people/skopf) via email to introduce yourself and inquire about opportunities (please attach a current CV in PDF format).

## Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students from all science and engineering majors. No matter which type of research you are interested in, starting as early as possible is key to being able to do some exciting research by the time you graduate, and many of our undergraduates lead their own research projects and contribute to scientific publications. We have various ways undergraduate students work with us from volunteers, [work study students](https://www.colorado.edu/studentemployment/work-study), and Undergraduate Research Opportunities [(UROP) assistantships](https://www.colorado.edu/urop/grants/student-grants/assistantships) for initial work experience (typically by assisting one of our graduate students, postdocs or staff scientists); to the Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training program ([SMART](https://www.colorado.edu/smart/undergraduates/smart-program-information/welcome-smart-2019)), Research Experience for Community College Students ([RECCS](https://cires.colorado.edu/outreach/RECCS)), [UROP individual grants](https://www.colorado.edu/urop/grants/student-grants/individual-grants), Biological Sciences Initiative [(BSI) scholarships](https://www.colorado.edu/bsi/bsi-scholars), and [undergraduate honors theses](https://scholar.colorado.edu/honr_theses/) for students interested in taking ownership of their own project.

## Graduate Students

Our lab admits graduate students through the [Department of Geological Sciences](https://www.colorado.edu/geologicalsciences/academic/graduate-degree-programs) as well as the [Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology Program](https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/). All prospective graduate students are highly encouraged to start planning early and apply for [graduate fellowships](https://www.colorado.edu/geologicalsciences/academic/graduate/graduate-fellowships) (typically due in early to mid fall). Programs that are particularly recommended to look into include the [NSF Graduate Student Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), the [Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellowship Award](http://hertzfoundation.org/fellowships/application), the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship Program](http://nationalacademies.org/ford), and the [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG)](https://ndseg.asee.org/).

## Postdoctoral Scholars

We are always looking for postdocs interested in the Geomicrobial Physiology and/or Organic Geochemistry Lab. Unfortunately, project grants with postdoc support are rare and prospective postdocs are thus encouraged to get in touch well ahead of their thesis defense (~9-12 months) with suggestions for pursuing fellowship funding opportunities. Possibilities include the [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship Programs](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3), the [Agouron Geobiology Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://agi.org/geobiology/fellowships/), the [Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](http://nationalacademies.org/ford), and the [Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/funding-opportunities).
