Welcome to our new graduate student [Harp Batther](/people/hbatther) who is going to work on methanogens jointly with the [Templeton lab](https://alexistempleton.myportfolio.com/), and research affiliate [Caj Neubauer](https://cajneubauer.weebly.com/) who will expand his work on soft-ionization stable isotope geochemistry in collaboration with our Organic and Isotope Geochemistry Lab. It's wonderful to have you both on the team and looking forward to the science ahead.
