The lab is expanding and we're excited to welcome [Elise Cowley](/people/elise/), [Kelsey Dahlgren](/people/kelsey/) and [Nabil Chaudhry](/people/nabil/). Elise and Kelsey are both graduate students in the [IQBio program](https://iqbiology.colorado.edu/) at CU Boulder and officially start their lab rotation in the Geomicrobial Physiolgy Lab this week. Elise joins us after rotating in the [Kralj](http://spot.colorado.edu/~jokr7175/index.html) and [Fierer](http://fiererlab.org/) labs in the fall and winter and will be working on the dynamics of predator-prey interactions in microbial food webs for her rotation. Kelsey finished her rotations in the [Cameron](http://www.colorado.edu/chembio/jeffrey-cameron) and [Schmidt](http://amo.colorado.edu/schmidtlab/people_steve.html) labs and will be working on the regulation of siderophore production in diazotrophs.
Nabil recently finished his undergraduate degree in the Geo department at CU Boulder working in the [Templeton Lab](http://spot.colorado.edu/~templeta/Templeton_Lab/Welcome.html) and will be studying isotope fractionation in acetogens. Welcome!
