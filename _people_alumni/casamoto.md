## Bio

Runner, knitter, baker, and scientist keen about nitrogen and microbes.

## About

Ciara is a PhD candidate studying how microbial physiology impacts the isotopic signature of denitrification. Her work involves culturing denitryfing bacteria in continuous culturing systems, stable isotope biogeochemistry, and genetics work. She loves the complexity of the nitrogen cycle and is excited about improving the ability for future researchers to understand it via stable isotopes.
