### The installation of our GC-IRMS is under way!

Our new gas-chromatograph (GC) isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) is getting installed and we are looking forward to getting everything up an running. This is one of the instruments housed in the Organic Geochemistry Laboratory (OGL) in the new Sustainability, Energy and Environment Complex (SEEC). The OGL is a shared space with Julio Sep√∫lveda and Gifford Miller that provides a fantastic environment for all types of organic geochemistry research. The new GC-IRMS will complement the existing instrumentation and analytical tools acquired by Julio (an LC-Orbitrap and GC-triple quadrupole) and will allow us to determine the isotopic composition of specific organic compounds buy coupling the separating power of a gas chromatograph via a combustion/pyrolysis interface to the precision of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
