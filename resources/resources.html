  <h4 class="media-heading">Organic Geochemistry Lab</h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    The Organic Geochemistry Lab is a joint laboratory space with Prof. Julio Sepulveda and Prof. Giff Miller located in the brand-new SEEL (Sustainability, Energy, Environment Labs) building. Construction is almost finished and the space is expected to be fully operational by Fall 2016. Details on available equipment and analytical instrumentation coming soon.

  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    The MBL lightbox is a reusable,
    submersible, battery-powered narrow-spectrum LED illumination chamber with a 3D
    printed, environmentally exposed microscope slide holder that was developed as a low-cost solution for wave-length specific in situ enrichment of phototrophic microorganisms at the 2015 MBL Microbial Diversity summer course. The method selectively enriches for microorganisms that thrive under the provided light regime(s) but within the natural chemical environment of their native habitat.

  <h4 class="media-heading">Isoreader R package
    <a href="https://isoreader.kopflab.org" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    This package is intended as a unified one-stop command line interface to all common IRMS (isotope ratio mass spectrometry) file formats used in stable isotope geochemistry. It enables the reading and processing of stable isotope data directly from the data files and thus provides a tool for platform-independent (Windows, Mac, Linux), efficient and reproducible data reduction.

  <h4 class="media-heading">Isoviewer R package
    <a href="https://isoviewer.kopflab.org" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    The isoviewer graphical user interface (GUI) provided by this package is based on the functionlity implemented by the isoreader package. The purpose of the GUI is two fold. First and foremost, it is a learning tool to illustrate how to build literate RMarkdown data processing files for IRMS data using the underlying isoreader package as a unified interface for reading, converting and quickly visualizing various raw IRMS data file formats. The second purpose is to provide an example for a web-based IRMS data repository that is easy to run on any computer/server completely platform-independent and open-source. A live demo is <a href="/isoviewer_demo/">available here</a>.

  <h4 class="media-heading">Isotopia R package
    <a href="http://isotopia.kopflab.org/" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    In stable isotope geochemical calculations, we use a number of different representations of isotopic information and processes (ratios, abundances, delta values, alpha values, epsilon values, fractionation factors, refereence frame shifts, mass balance calculations, mass-independent effects, etc., etc.) that are constantly being converted back and forth and used for different kinds of isotope arithmetic. Very frequently, the tangle of keeping track of this information and how all the calculations are done properly makes code very hard to read, difficult to communicate - or even understand oneself later on, and as anyone knows who's ever dropped a -1 or x1000 at the wrong place, prone to small mistakes that can make a huge difference. Isotopia is an R package that uses the S4 object system of R to define elemental isotopic data classes so that it can automatically keep track of what is a ratio, what is a delta value (and is it in permil notation or in ppm), etc., and perform isotope arithmetic accordingly.

  <h4 class="media-heading">Media Chem Tools R package
    <a href="https://mediatools.kopflab.org" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    The mediatools package is a collection of tools to simplify working with the chemical composition and speciation of defined culture media for microbial physiology and environmental microbiology research. It includes a wide range of general purpose functionality for chemical applications including built-in, data-frame-compatible chemical quantities (volume, mass, molarity, temperature, pressure, etc.) that automatically keep track of their units and metric scaling, as well as more specialized tools for the assembly and comparison of culturing media recipes, pH buffering strategies and aqueous speciation.

  <h4 class="media-heading">Isotope labeling calculator
    <a href="http://server.kopflab.com/shiny/apps/isolabel/" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    This app is intended for use in estimating expected enrichments from stable isotope labeling in microbial populations. It is based on isotopic enrichment resulting from unbiased clonal growth in the presence of an isotopic label. This app is intended to make it easy to explore this space for different isotope systems and takes care of all the isotope conversions and mixing calculations between existing and isotopically labelled pools.

    <a href="http://server.kopflab.com/shiny/apps/nitrogen_cycle_dynamics/" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    This app is a visual tool to explore the isotope dynamics of the nitrogen cycle. Its goal is to make the different processes more accessible and help students gain a more intuitive understanding of how they change the ocean's nitrogen reservoirs. All plots can be saved as PDF and can of course be used freely, especially for educational purposes. The application is released as open software under the GNU General Public License 3.0.

    <a href="https://github.com/sebkopf/isocyclr#isocyclr" class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a>
  </h4>
  <div class="media-body">
    This R package is intended as an educational tool to facilitate the modeling of isotopic effects through biogeochemical pathways and cycles including non-steady state and steady-state solutions. Core functionality for the construction of reaction networks and the corresponding system of differential equations is fully implemented and can be explored for multiple isotope systems in parallel. Automatically generated reaction diagrams and symbolic representation of the system of differential equations make it easy to check system structure.
