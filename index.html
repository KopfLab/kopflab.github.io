## About the lab

We study

## Open Source Policy

In the spirit of fostering collaboration and advancing the pace of discovery we strive to make all our lab designs and software development openly available and easily accessible to other scientists and students.


<h1>Starting in Fall 2016 yay</h1>

<div class="media">
  <div class="media-body">

    <p>The GeoMicrobial Physiology lab at the University of Colorado Boulder will open its doors in the Fall of 2016 when I start as an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/" target="new">Department of Geological Sciences</a>.
      The lab will focus on studying the physiological drivers of geochemical fingerprints of microbial metabolism, particularly isotopic effects and molecular markers.</p>

    <p>My lab is part of the newly expanding Geobiology program at CU Boulder, that also comprises <a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~templeta/Templeton_Lab/Welcome.html" target="new">Alexis Templeton's</a>, <a href="https://instaar.colorado.edu/people/julio-sepulveda/" target="new">Julio Sepulveda's</a> and <a href="http://isotope.colorado.edu/" target="new">Steve Mojzsis'</a> groups, and has close ties with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (<a href="https://instaar.colorado.edu/" target="new">INSTAAR</a>) and the <a href="https://biofrontiers.colorado.edu/" target="new">Biofrontiers Institute</a>.</p>


    <p>Please note that this website is still under construction and more information will follow soon. In the meantime, please contact me at sebastian.kopf (at) colorado.edu about upcoming research opportunities at CU Boulder.</p>
