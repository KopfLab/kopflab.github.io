# About

My main research interests involve the application of analytical techniques to biogeochemical processes relating to natural environments. Previously, I applied a wide range of molecular and stable isotope approaches to investigate the flow of Carbon from atmospheric methane into the soils through analysis of microbial biomarkers. In addition to that, I also studied paleo-climates by applying stable isotope approaches to sediments through analysis of fossils biomarkers. Iâ€™m also interested in developing and applying organic geochemistry and molecular/isotopic biogeochemical approaches to environmental studies. I believe there are considerable prospects for developing innovative new approaches due to the wide ranging geochemical and biogeochemical interests that exist here at CU Boulder.
