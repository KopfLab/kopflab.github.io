Microbes are everywhere! They are the unseen force that rules our planet. This class provides beginner friendly lab & research experience working on a microbiology project. The course teaches how to conduct original scientific research from hypothesis to experimentation, evaluation and reporting. Students study non-pathogenic microorganisms they isolate themselves from nature as part of the course. Hands-on topics covered in class include how to isolate & culture new microbes; how to observe, describe and classify them; and how to examine their metabolic capabilities such as the production of antibiotics.
